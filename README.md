# Tibetan-Handwriting-Dataset

The scarcity of Tibetan handwriting datasets has hindered the advancement of prevailing artificial intelligence models in Tibetan language applications. This study proposes a methodology to establish a Tibetan handwritten Khyug-yig dataset. It incorporates conventional approaches used for building English and Chinese datasets. Our Khyug-yig dataset contains the most common writing style found in the daily lives of Tibetan people. The proposed method emphasizes the process of specifying textual content from multiple websites prior to collecting and processing data, with a focus on constructing and categorizing a Tibetan Lexicon. The study collected 9874 Khyug-yig words from 63 Tibetan writers across diverse institutions, including Changdu Cityâ€™s Sixth Senior High School, Tibet University, and a local calligraphy association. The dataset was then processed through form scanning, cropping, grouping, and labeling. Lastly, the paper performs an analysis of the word distributions in multi-categorical words within the Tibetan Handwriting Khyug-yig Dataset.

Subsequent data will be updated gradually, please stay tuned.
